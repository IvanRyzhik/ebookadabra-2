<p>Ebookadabra is a reading experience aimed at young families with kids aged from three to seven years old. It is a world where kids will discover books for themselves, be rewarded for their reading and be able to share the experience with their family. We offer a family hundreds of books and related learning activities on a subscription business model whereby a subscriber is granted unlimited access in return for payment of a fee.</p>
