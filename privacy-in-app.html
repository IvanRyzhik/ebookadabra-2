<p>4.1  We may maintain, use and share statistical data relating to usage of the Service.  Any usage data that is maintained, used or shared will be done so on an anonymous, aggregate basis that does not identify any individual user so that your and your child's individual usage cannot be identified separately.

This information is used to customise content to your child's age and interests and to send you birthday offers in the week before their birthday.  We do not use or disclose this information for any other purpose. </p>
          
<p>5.2  Further to protect our users we comply with the guidelines set out in the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).
