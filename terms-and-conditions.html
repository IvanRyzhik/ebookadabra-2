     <h1>TERMS &amp; CONDITIONS OF USE</h1>

     <p>
      Ebookadabra is provided by Moondog Books Limited (“Moondog”, “we”, “us”, “our”). Thank you for choosing us as your children's subscription reading service.</p>

      <h2>1. INTRODUCTION</h2>
      <p>1.1 These terms and conditions of use (the "Terms") shall govern your use of our application, services and website (together the "Service").</p>
      <p>1.2 You will be asked to give your express agreement to these Terms, and our Privacy Policy (<u>together</u> referred to as the "Terms &amp; Conditions") before you subscribe to or use our Service. If you don’t agree with the Terms &amp; Conditions, then please don’t use the Service.</p>
      <p>1.3 Although the Service is for the benefit of all your family the Terms &amp; Conditions are between us and the adult subscribing to the Service.</p>
      <p>1.4 Moondog Books, not Apple, is responsible for the Ebookadabra application and its content. Apple is not a party to the Terms &amp; Conditions nor is it responsible for the application.
        <h2>2. YOUR ACCESS TO THE SERVICE</h2>
        <p><em>Subscription</em></p>
        <p>2.1 The Service is an ad-free, paid subscription service which enables you and your children to access and read a library of content when online and to store in your device’s memory for off-line reading up to 15 books per profile (your &quot;Library&quot;) (&quot;Subscription&quot;). You may access the Service on an unlimited number of mobile devices while your Subscription is active but the number of concurrent sessions on those devices will be limited to five and the number of profiles available to you in the application will be limited to four (in addition to the parent profile) unless you pay an additional fee to increase the number of profiles (”Profile Limit”). If you require more profiles, let us know and we can increase this limit in return for a small additional payment.</p>
        <p><em>Trials</em></p>
        <p>2.2 From time to time, we may offer trials of the Service for a specified period without payment (a “Trial”). We reserve the right, in our absolute discretion, to determine your eligibility for a Trial, and to withdraw or to modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability. The
          Terms &amp; Conditions shall govern your use of our Service during a Trial.</p>
          <p>For some Trials, we will require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial. At the end of such Trials, we may automatically start to charge you for the Service on the first day following the end of the Trial period, on a recurring monthly basis. By providing your payment details in conjunction with the Trial, you agree to this charge.</p>
          <h2>3. SUBSCRIPTION PROCESS; RENEWALS; TERMINATION; PRICING</h2>
          <p>3.1 The advertising of our Service constitutes a promotion rather than a contractual offer.</p>
          <p>3.2 No contract will come into force between you and us unless and until we accept your registration in accordance with the procedure set out in this Section 3.</p>
          <p>3.3 As a new customer, whether using the Service on a Trial basis or not, you must create an account with us and log in. As part of this process you will be required to agree to the Terms &amp; Conditions.
          </p>
          <p>3.4 Our prices are quoted on the subscription pages of our website or in the application itself and you may be asked to select the terms of your Subscription (e.g. length, type and price of subscription). If you subscribe on our website you will be transferred to our payment service provider's website, and our payment service provider will handle your payment; we will then send you an initial acknowledgement; and we will either send you an order confirmation and a payment receipt (at which point your order will become a binding contract with us) or we will confirm by email that we are unable to accept your subscription and any payment you have made will be refunded to you (“Payment Transaction”). If you subscribe within the application the relevant application store will handle the Payment Transaction in accordance with their agreement with you.
          </p>
          <p>3.5 Your Subscription to the Service, and your payment will automatically renew at the end of the subscription period, unless you cancel your Subscription, either on our website or in the app store as relevant, no less than 7 days prior to the end of the current subscription period. The cancellation will then take effect at the end of the last day of the current subscription period. If you cancel your payment after the Cancellation Period (see Section 6.2) is over and/or before the end of the subscription period, we will not refund any subscription fees already paid to us.
          </p>
          <p>3.6 We may terminate the Terms &amp; Conditions or suspend your access to the Service at any time, including in the event of your actual or suspected unauthorised use of the Service or non-compliance with the Terms &amp; Conditions. If the Terms &amp; Conditions are terminated or if your access to the Service is suspended, you agree that we shall have no liability or responsibility to you and we will not refund any amounts that you have already paid. To understand how to terminate your Subscription to the Service refer to our FAQ’s.
          </p>
          <p>3.7 We may change the subscription price from time to time, and we will communicate any price changes to you through our website, in app store or by email, as appropriate. Subscription price changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date the price change is communicated. By continuing to use the Service after the price change takes effect, you accept the new price.</p>
